            <p><u class="underline-green">This claim is true.</u> With the raucous national debate over health care, it’s been difficult to differentiate political grandstanding from meaningful policy discourse. But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, one of the few remaining independent bodies in the capital, has made it crystal clear: the Republicans’ House and Senate plans for health care will cause tens of millions of Americans to lose their health coverage.</p>
            <p>The Senate plan would <a class="green-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.factcheck.org/2017/03/the-facts-on-the-gop-health-care-bill/"> remove Obamacare’s individual mandate</a>, meaning Americans without health insurance will not face an annual tax penalty. It would also <a class="green-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/29/fact-checking-senate-gop-health-care-bill/"> return $540 billion to the country’s top earners</a> (those making over $250,000 annually) that Obamacare taxed to help pay for the Affordable Care Act. The C.B.O. also estimated that the proposed Senate G.O.P. plan would <a class="green-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/29/fact-checking-senate-gop-health-care-bill/"> help reduce the federal deficit by $321 billion by 2026</a>, mostly due to cuts in Medicaid spending.</p>

            <p>Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have repeatedly <a class="red-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/CBO-medical-insurance-GOP/2017/05/24/id/792190/"> criticized the C.B.O.’s projections as “wrong.”</a> In May the C.B.O. projected that 23 million Americans would lose health coverage under the House plan, and then in July projected that 22 million would lose coverage under the Senate plan. Some news outlets have also tried to discount the C.B.O.’s projections <a class="red-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/06/27/cbo-predictions-about-the-senate-health-care-bill-are-deeply-flawed/#7af93c6779d4"> by highlighting correlations</a> in the budget office’s health care reports over the years, which have no statistical standing, or <a class="red-link" target="_blank" href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2017/05/25/no-the-republican-healthcare-bill-would-not-cause-23-million-people-to-lose-insurance-n2331434"> by trying to redefine what it means to have current coverage.</a></p>
            <p>The White House, too, joined in on <a class="red-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/26/heres-how-well-the-cbo-did-at-forecasting-the-last-big-health-care-bill/?utm_term=.a7c5e5bcc654"> undermining the credibility of the budget office</a> rather than face the facts. "The CBO has consistently proven it cannot accurately predict how healthcare legislation will impact insurance coverage," the White House said in a statement. "This history of inaccuracy, as demonstrated by its flawed report on coverage, premiums, and predicted deficit arising out of Obamacare, reminds us that its analysis must not be trusted blindly." When it comes to Obamacare, though, the budget office’s projections have come in under budget even with the wrench the Supreme Court threw in by making the Medicaid expansion optional for states.</p>
            <p>What’s true for Americans on both sides of the political spectrum is the fact that the debate over health care won’t be over anytime soon.</p>
